# Changelog Component

This project is focused on creating a responsive and visually appealing changelog component using HTML and CSS. The changelog component displays a timeline of updates, with dates and descriptions aligned around a visual indicator (dot and line). The component is designed to be easily integrated into a website and is optimized for various screen sizes.
